# Car_BlackBox_Using_LPC1768

This project is a secure access system using an LPC17xx microcontroller, integrating a keypad, LCD display, and various functionalities like password authentication, temperature sensing, real-time clock (RTC), and audio selection. The system prompts the user to enter a password, and upon successful authentication, allows access to features such as displaying the date and time, measuring temperature via an ADC, and selecting audio languages. The project demonstrates the use of GPIO, ADC, RTC, and LCD interfacing, along with keypad scanning and password validation, providing a comprehensive example of embedded system design.
